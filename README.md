# Exam Seating Arrangement - MERN
The goal is to create a web-based system to manage exam seating arrangements, which will digitize the exam seat allocation on campus. The proposed exam hall seat allocation system aims to automate the seat
allocation process, reduce administrative workload, and provide an efficient and
effective solution that scales to accommodate large numbers of students. This project has the potential to improve the student experience and increase
the security and accuracy of the exam process.
